### Formatting for a Presentation

Consider which slide format you are formatting for.
For example, if you use the older (but still quasi-standard) 4:3 format the dimenstions are 25.4cm width and 19.05cm height. You would use

```json
    "PaperPosition": [0 0 25.4 19.05],
```

in your profile json file.  
But if you want to format for the newer 16:9 format you want to consider the slide dimensions of 33.85cm width and 19.05cm. You would use

```json
    "PaperPosition": [0 0 33.85 19.05],
```

in your profile json file.
